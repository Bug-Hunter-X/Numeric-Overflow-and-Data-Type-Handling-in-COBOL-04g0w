This repository demonstrates a potential bug in a COBOL program related to numeric overflow and data type handling.  The program increments a numeric variable. If it surpasses a certain threshold it's copied to another variable.  The bug arises if the initial variable overflows its defined size before the copy operation. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle potential overflow conditions, ensuring data integrity and preventing unexpected results.
